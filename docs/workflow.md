# Runme in the GitOps workflow

Runme is the codification of DevOps workflows into reliable, refinable, reusable assets (stored in Git as Markdown) that when consumed with one of our clients become interactive Runme Notebooks. A Runme Notebook can contain all the attributes needed to successfully run a workflow: human instruction, scripts/code, .ENV (secrets & config), devContainers, cloud integrations and system dependencies.

Further down in these docs, we will show how comprehensive and capable Runme is at capturing both simple and very complex operations. Modeling workflows in Runme Notebooks enables DevOps teams to capture, persist, and share operational knowledge across the organization and unblock engineering.
