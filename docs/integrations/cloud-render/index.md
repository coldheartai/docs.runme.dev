# Runme Cloud Renderer

## Overview

Runme Notebook Cloud Renderers enable you to interact with your cloud resources directly within your interactive notebook in your Markdown file.

The integration between Runme's Cloud Renderer and cloud service platforms allows you to perform tasks such as listing, managing, and SSH into a virtual machine, all within a single interface.

This eliminates the need to open the console separately; you can access its functionality within your Notebook file.

This section will introduce you to and walk you through using the Runme Notebook Cloud Renderers with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
