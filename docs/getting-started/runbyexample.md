# Runme by Example

Discover the various ways you can use Runme to run your code straight from your markdown file. Explore our [example page](https://runme.dev/examples) to learn more exciting ways you can use Runme. These examples showcase improved ways you can use Runme, such as in [hardening your Ubuntu server](https://runme.dev/blog/hardening-ubuntu), within your dev container, etc. In this section, you will find a variety of features and examples to help you get the most out of Runme.

## **1. Advanced Usage of Piping and Variables**

Runme was configured in a default mode to prevent variables in one cell from being accessed directly in another cell. However, you can let go of this default mode by using Piping which is declared using `$__`, to pass a variable declared in a previous execution to another cell in the same file.

Runme swiftly allows for complex piping and usage of variables across cells. Here is an example using Git:

- **List Git Branches Matching a Pattern**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ3W00K4ZPSXSH2PSGMQ1Z"}
git branch | grep "feature-"
```

- **Process the Output in a Subsequent Cell**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ4RR371G2PTEPCADCP58A"}
echo "$__" | while read line
do
  if [ ! -z "$line" ]; then echo "Feature branch: ${line}"; fi
done
```

## **2. Working with Stdin, Stdout, and Stderr**

As a system administrator or developer, using standard streams for scripting, automation, error handling, and managing system resources is one common task in your day-to-day life.

In this section, we have crafted examples to demonstrate various ways to work with `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`, in Runme.

- **Reading from `stdin` and writing to `stdout`**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ63TDRDBDB1K8YE3MJFRW"}
$ cat
Enter your text here.
^D
```

In this example, `cat` is invoked without any arguments, so it waits for input from `stdin`. After entering text and pressing `^D` (Ctrl+D), it writes the input to `stdout`.

- **Redirecting `stdin` and `stdout`**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ74ZHBXBJS0HHTEXERNN4"}
$ cat < input.txt > output.txt
```

Here, cat reads from `input.txt` (redirected `stdin`) and writes to `output.txt` (redirected stdout).

- **Appending to an Existing File**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ86BFADA7SQVM0BVRB1SM"}
$ echo "New content." >> existing_file.txt
```

This appends the text "New content." to the file `existing_file.txt`.

- **Redirecting stderr**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZ9CT9SB0QR5ZEEMAK4XCG"}
$ ls non_existent_dir 2> error_log.txt
```

If __`ls`__ encounters an error (like trying to list a non-existent directory), the error message will be redirected to __`error_log.txt`__.

- **Redirecting `stderr` to `stdout`**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZAJG8NYGF6YQCPFK6VKFY"}
$ ls non_existent_dir 2>&1
```

This redirects both `stderr` and `stdout` to the same destination, which is typically the terminal.

* Piping Output:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZCAWM3AT6YRCV4VCMN5B0"}
$ ls | grep ".txt"
```

This pipes the output of **`ls`** (which lists files and directories) to **`grep`**, which filters lines containing ".txt".

- **Redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to Different Files**:

```sh {"id":"01HRVZD04JQ48QWPHT46EMG1F3"}
$ myprogram > output.log 2> error.log
```

This runs myprogram, directing `stdout` to `output.log` and stderr to `error.log`, allowing for separate logging of standard output and error messages.
