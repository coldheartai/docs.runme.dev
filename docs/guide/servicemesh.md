# Runme via Service Mesh

Runme provides an interactive notebook that enhances the development of workflows and execution of codes and commands. This guide explores how to set up and work with Istio Service mesh right inside a Markdown file. You will learn how to:

- Install Istio CLI
- Set up your cluster
- Deploy a sample application
- Expose and verify the application
- handle traffic management and clean up

## Prerequisite

To follow up on this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

**Runme Extension:** Install the Runme extension in your VS Code editor and set it as your default Markdown viewer.

**Clone Repo:** We have provided an example repository to help you follow this tutorial. You can clone the repo here.

```
git clone https://github.com/stateful/blog-examples.git
```

**Required Packages:** Install the required packages (kind, kubectl, git, helm ) in your Markdown file. Runme allows you to achieve this! Simply run the command below.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
brew install kind
brew install docker
brew install yq
```

The command above installsÂ `brew`Â andÂ `git,`Â and creates a local Kubernetes Cluster usingÂ [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

ðŸ’¡ For your kind cluster to run, you need to have docker running.

### Install Istio CLI[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#install-istio-cli)

Download the Istio release and install the Istio CLI.

```
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
```

Replace `<version>` with the version of Istio you download

```bash
cd istio-<version>
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```

## **Setting Up Your Cluster**[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/argocd-cli#setting-up-your-cluster)

To proceed with this tutorial, you are required to set up your Kubernetes cluster. This is an important step as it ensures that service mesh can manage your microservices application.

The first step in setting up your cluster is to check if any already exist and delete it. To do that, run the command below.

```
kind delete cluster --name helm-runme
```

Next, use `kind` to create a Kubernetes cluster locally. For this tutorial, the name of the Kubernetes cluster will beÂ `runme-mesh`. To create this, run the command below.

```
kind create cluster --name runme-mesh
```

After creating a cluster, the next step is to inspect the cluster to ensure it is running and healthy. To do this, run the command below.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info â€” context kind-runme-mesh
```

If you would like to inspect namespaces, execute the command below

```
kubectl get ns
```

To create a new namespace, execute the command below

```
kubectl create namespace mesh
```

## Install Istio on Kubernetes[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#install-istio-on-kubernetes)

After successfully setting up your cluster, the next step is to install Istio on Kubernetes.

You can use the `istioctl` command to install Istio. There are different profiles available, but for this tutorial we are using `demo` .

```
istioctl install --set profile=demo
```

To verify the installation of Istio, run the command below:

```
istioctl verify-install
```

## Verify Istio Components[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#verify-installation)

Ensure all Istio components are running correctly.

```
kubectl get pods -n istio-system
```

You should see pods for `istiod`, `istio-ingressgateway`, and other components.

## Label the Namespace for Istio Injection[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#label-the-namespace-for-istio-injection)

After complete verification of all Istio components, you need to label the namespaces where your application is deployed for automatic sidecar injection. Run the command below to achieve this.

```
kubectl label namespace <your-namespace> istio-injection=enabled
```

Be sure to replace `your-namespace` with the name of the namespace where Istio is running.

## Deploy Sample Application[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#deploy-sample-application)

In this section, we will deploy a sample application to verify that the service mesh is working as it should.

To achieve this, run the command below.

```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml
```

Using the [Runme cwd feature](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/cell-level#cells-current-working-directory), you can confidently set your code cell block to the path where `samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml` is located on your local machine (the sample folder is inside of `istio-<version>` that you downloaded earlier).

## Expose the Application[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#expose-the-application)

After deploying your sample application, the next step is to expose the application using the Istio ingress gateway. Run the command below to do this.

```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```

 [Runme cwd feature](https://docs.runme.dev/configuration/cell-level#cells-current-working-directory) here to set your code cell block to the path where `samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml` is located (the sample folder is inside of `istio-<version>` that you downloaded earlier).

## Verify the Application[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#verify-the-application)

To verify the application and check the ingress IP and port, run the command below.

```
kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
```

If you would want to analyze the entire cluster, run the command below.

```
  isrioctl analyze --all-namespaces
```

[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#additional-configuration)

## Traffic Management[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#traffic-management)

Now the next step is to properly handle traffic management. To do this, you need to create a `VirtualService` that will define the routing rules. The example in this tutorial routes all traffic to the `reviews` service to version `v1`

To begin traffic management, first create a file named `runme-virtual-service-reviews-v1.yaml` by running the script below.

```
cat << EOF > runme-virtual-service-reviews-v1.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
EOF
```

Next, run this command.

```bash
kubectl apply -f runme-virtual-service-reviews-v1.yaml
```

**Set Up Destination Rules**

After creating the file, you need to define the subsets for the `reviews` service. To do this, create a file named `destination-rule-reviews.yaml` that will contain the following configuration:

```bash
cat << EOF > runme-virtual-service-reviews-v1.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  host: reviews
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2
  - name: v3
    labels:
      version: v3

 EOF
```

Now, apply the configuration by executing the command below:

```bash
kubectl apply -f destination-rule-reviews.yaml
```

**Implementing Traffic Shifting**

You can gradually shift traffic between different versions of a service. For example, shifting 50% of the traffic to version `v2` and the other 50% to version `v3`.

To do this, create a file named `runme-virtual-service-reviews-shifting.yaml` and give it the following configurations:

```bash
cat << EOF > runme-virtual-service-reviews-shifting.yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 50
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v3
      weight: 50

 EOF
```

**Testing the Configuration**

Test the routing rules by accessing the application. To do this, you can utilize Runmeâ€™s environment variable prompt feature to use the external IP of the Istio Ingress Gateway:

```bash
export GATEWAY_URL=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
curl http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```

## Security[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#security)

To boost the application's security, we will enable strict mutual TLS mode in Istio, which secures service-to-service communication and provides authentication to protect sensitive data.

To do this, run the script below.

```
cat << EOF > installation/values-override.yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
EOF
```

## Observability[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/servicemesh#observability)

To get a visual view of your application's progress, consider integrating with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger for metrics, dashboards, and tracing.

Run this command to do that.

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/addons
```

## Cleanup[](https://docs-runme-q3n6krjle-stateful.vercel.app/guide/agrocd#cleanup)

After successfully deploying your application to Argo CD, you can clean up. In cleaning up, you are to remove application and application project definition files in the git repository `sample-app.yaml` and `sample-project.yaml` . Here are some steps to achieve this:

**Step One:** Uninstall argo-cd helm deployment.

```
helm uninstall argocd
```

**Step Two:** Wait until all resources are deleted in argocd namespace and run the command below to verify.

```
kubectl -n mesh get pods
```

**Step Three:** DeleteÂ `argocd`Â namespaces.

```
kubectl delete ns mesh
```

**Step Four:** Delete kind cluster.

```
kind delete cluster --name my-cluster
```
