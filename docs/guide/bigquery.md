# Manage Data Queries with BigQuery and Runme

Runme is designed to simplify the management and execution of your tasks while documenting your process. With Runme, you can integrate with BigQuery to run queries easily and efficiently.

In this guide, you will first authenticate your BigQuery account, set up your project configuration, and then run a series of query operations using Runmeâ€™s integrated environment.

### Prerequisites

To follow up on this guide, ensure you have the following:

**Runme Extension**

Install the [Runme extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stateful.runme) in your VS Code editor. Runme also provides other client interfaces where you can run your Markdown file. See the [Runme installation guide](../installation/index). You can also make Runme your default Markdown viewer, with this every Markdown with your code editor will be accessed as a Notebook. 

**Install Google Cloud SDK**

To interact with Google Cloud resources, you need to install the Google Cloud SDK. This SDK provides the necessary tools and libraries. Run the command below to install:

```sh {"id":"01J2B9V1NA28V0KFGPAYZP10V0"}
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

For Other platforms Consult [GCP's official docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

## Authenticate with Google Cloud

To get started, you need to authenticate your Google Cloud account using the `gcloud auth` feature which allows you have access to google cloud resources. Run the command:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSRX57KFSZ"}
gcloud auth login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in with your Google account.

**List Available Components**

Check which components are available or installed in your Google Cloud SDK. Run the command below to do this:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSS05NY5CD"}
gcloud components list
```

![Componenets list](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-list-component.png)

**Update Google Cloud Components**

Run the command below to ensure your Google Cloud components are up to date:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSS26D4ST8"}
gcloud components update
```

**Install the BigQuery Component**

with the authentication completed, you can proceed to install your BigQuery component

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSS5X947XP"}
gcloud components install bq
```

### Set Your Project

First, set your Google Cloud project ID using an [environment vairable](../getting-started/features#environment-variable-prompts). This allows you to specify the project you want to work with in your notebook. To set your project ID, run the command below:

```sh {"id":"01J2B992A1G2K3PT40FDHV4QZ9"}
export PROJECT_ID="runme-ci"
echo "PROJECT_ID set to $PROJECT_ID"
```

Configure the `gcloud` CLI to use your specific Google Cloud project:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSS7M7C8P5"}
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `runme-ci` with the ID of your project.

## BigQuery Operations

### Querying BigQuery

You can now run a query against your BigQuery dataset. For example, to select data from a specific table, use the following command:

```sh {"id":"01J2BC81H7AVSXV28Z52C1QYM9"}
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT * FROM `[PROJECT_ID].[DATASET].[TABLE]` LIMIT 10'
```

![query](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-bq-query.png)

This command will return the first 10 rows from the `runme-query` table in the `runme_bigquery` dataset.

### Listing Datasets and Tables

To list all datasets in your project:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSCE4YYGS"}
bq ls
```

![List tables](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-bq-ls.png)

To list all tables in a specific dataset (e.g., `runme_bigquery`):

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSDVX8AD6"}
bq ls runme_bigquery
```

![list data set](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-list-bigquery.png)

To show details of a specific table (e.g., `runme-query`):

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSGGCRD0W"}
bq show runme_bigquery.runme-query
```

![show table](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-show-bigquery.png)

**Load Data into a Table**

To load data from a CSV file into a table in Google BigQuery run the command below:

```sh {"id":"01J2BCAB5QYAHCBFDK5JRSCR8G"}
bq load --source_format=CSV [DATASET].[TABLE] [PATH_TO_CSV_FILE] [SCHEMA]
```

```sh {"id":"01J2BH3RJYZVD6XRAHQ198FVD5"}
bq load --source_format=CSV --skip_leading_rows=1 runme_bq.runme_table ./101.csv ./schema.json
```

![bq load](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-bq-load.png)

**Export Data from a Table**

To extract data from a table and save it as a CSV file in your storage system (GCS bucket), run the command below 

```sh {"id":"01J2BCARNPK25F2YAPAZ22GHK8"}
bq extract --destination_format=CSV [DATASET].[TABLE] gs://[BUCKET]/[FILE_NAME].csv
```

### Creating a Dataset

If you need to create a new dataset, use:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSH4MHA49"}
bq mk runme_bq
```

![create table](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-create-table.png)

## Delete Dataset

Delete all tables and views within the dataset

```sh {"id":"01J2E7RCKGKX96ZBFTSJJZWMGZ"}
bq rm -r -f [PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET]
```

### Creating a Table

To create a new table within your dataset:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSKJSA3RH"}
bq mk --table runme_bq.new_table
```

```sh {"id":"01J2BCDZYCG9HJ1CY1J4W1RXAG"}
bq mk --table [DATASET].[TABLE] schema.json

```

```sh {"id":"01J2BEKT3ZJ208SC046E6F8THW"}
bq mk --table runme_bq.runme_table schema.json
```

![use schema](../../static/img/guide-page/runme_bigquery-schema.png)

**Delete a Table**

To delete a table from your BigQuery run the command below 

```sh {"id":"01J2BCCW3DTQ090CY0PGSGT5FZ"}
bq rm -f [DATASET].[TABLE]
```

![remove table](../../static/img/guide-page/runme-bigquery-remove-table.png)

This command forcefully deletes the table named `runme_table` in the dataset `runme_bq` 

**Create a Table with Expiration Time**

You can create a partitioned table with an expiration in BigQuery 

```sh {"id":"01J2BCGHCEX7XV8EZAG9DC02D3"}
bq mk --table --time_partitioning_expiration 2592000000 my_dataset.temporary_data schema.json
```

### Getting Help

If you need additional help with BigQuery commands, you can view the help documentation:

```sh {"id":"01J2B937J9DH0TPAHSSMS5B4AF"}
bq --help
```

### Conclusion

You have successfully set up, configured Google BigQuery and execute SQL queries on BigQuery within your Runme notebook. [Runme](../index) enhances your data operations by providing a simple, efficient, and powerful interface for working with Google BigQuery.
